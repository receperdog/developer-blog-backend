# Developer Blog Backend

## Overview
The Developer Blog Backend is a comprehensive system designed for managing a blogging platform. While the application is still under development, it will empower users with the capability to create, edit, and publish blog posts seamlessly. Additionally, it boasts an intuitive user authentication mechanism, robust post management features, and a sophisticated commenting system that supports nested comments.

Built with Spring Boot and leveraging JPA for ORM, this backend is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, ensuring that as your platform grows, the system can grow with it.
